# 1.1.0
* Added drawGridOnTop param to XYGraphWidget; when set to true, grid lines will be drawn on top of rendered series data.  (default is false)
* Added PanZoom class providing one-line configuration of pan/zoom behavior for instances of XYPlot.  See TouchZoomExampleActivity for a usage example.
* Removed InteractiveXYPlot as PanZoom makes it obsolete.

# 1.0.0
This is a factor of several core elements of the Androidplot lib.  The general theme was to 
make class and method names more intuitive and to make xml styling more powerful.
* Major refactor of XYGraphWidget
* Tick renamed to Line
* Extensible Label Formatters
* getXXXWidget methods renamed to simply getXXX
* Per-edge tick extensions
* Moved documentation into vcs.  Docs from 1.0 forward will be maintained here. (TODO)
* plot label xml param renamed to title
